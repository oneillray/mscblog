# Personalisation

- when was the term first coined?
- what are obvious, everyday examples of personalisation?



The goal of news website is to 'appeal to a wide-range of people with different motivations' (Marshall, 2007). Much work has been done in the area of personalisation has been in measuring the algorithms success in influencing user engagement [ref] and compare the various methods of personalisation [ref]. However very little has been done in the way of measuring the effectiveness of various interaction design techniques in getting users to start using personalisation.  

## What is it? (100)
Personalisation can be described as:
> A form of user-to-system interactivity that uses a set of technological features to adapt the content, delivery, and arrangement of a communication to individual users’ explicitly registered and / or implicitly determined preferences.

(Thurman & Schifferes, 2012)

Personalisation can be described as the customisation of a user experience by the system being used. (Schade, 2016). Personalisation often referred to as 'recommender systems' address the problem of information overload on content websites by delivering content that addresses the interest of that user or group of user of similar interests.  Personalisation can be executed by either implicit or explicit means. It is important to explain what both these terms mean as later it method used will be decided.

### Content Filtering

### Collaborative filtering


(Thurman & Schifferes, 2012) describe **Explicit personalisation** as the means of a user directly inter their user preferences to customise their reading experience. Explicit personalisation can be seen in various flavours within online new publishing, the most of which is the presentation of a 'My News' view is apparent in the BBCs mobile applications.

**Implicit Personalisation** on the contrary requires no user interaction and content is often presented without the user being aware of the profiling and how the content is being personalised to their interests. There are many examples of this, the most obvious example is google search. When you type 'news' in google the results returned will be relevant to your geolocation.  [Ref needed]

## Why is it important ? (100)


- It brings value to the end user.
- Analytics - business intelligence

Personalisation brings value to user but providing them with a customised experience that caters to their needs and goals. The main benefit of personalisation to the user is it that it can deliver content to users that interest them.

## Value proposition

Personalisation is a strategy that is being adopted by news organisations to ensure that their content is remains relevant to individual users and to help keep their readers engaged by offering they an aggregated news feed which is [relevant] to their interests.

Another huge benefit of personalisation is that it allow for companies gain deep knowledge of their users behaviour patterns, which has huge financial opportunities for publishers to become behaviours. Eli Pariser (2011) states unless newspapers...think of themselves as behavioural data companies with a mission [to produce] information about their readers’ preferences” they will be “sunk”.

### Personalisation Teardown's

According to [ref] their are three dimensions of personalisation that can be explored. These are:

1. The aspect of information
2. Who is being personalised
3. Who does the personalisation ( the user or the machine )

1. The aspect of information.
Wishing the personalisation the information further personalisation can be categorised by:
* personalising the content itself
* How the information is being presented ( the user interface )
* The medium for which the information is being presented
*  and what users can do with the information ( the functionality )

Some practical examples of types of personalisation within the context of news applications.
