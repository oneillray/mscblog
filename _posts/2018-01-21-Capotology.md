## Capotology


Capotology is the fancy word for the study of computers as persuasive technologies. In essence, it is the study of behavioural design, research, ethics and analysis of technology.

Changing a behaviour of a user could be as small as clicking a button or as big as changing their habit throughout the day. When taking on this research project first thing I needed figure out was how do you approach a behavioural change project? Just like any design project. It's very for me to go ahead and start crafting a user interface in Sketch or start mapping out some user flows. Wendel (2013) on the other hand, suggests that you need to start with the behaviour that you are trying to change. Asking questions like "how can we reimagine an action" based on what we learn in the understanding + discover phases better place to approach a behaviour design change project.

In summary, the design process could be project could be outlined by the following three things:

- Action- Structure the target action to make possible and attractive.
- Environment - Develop a decision-making environment that will support the target action
- The User- Prepare the users to take action.


According to Wendel (2013), designing behaviour change follows a four-phase process, not too dissimilar to a human- centred design process. These phases are:

1. Understanding how the mind decides to act and what that means for behaviour change
2. Discovering the right behaviours to change, give the business goals and the users goals.
3. Designing the product itself are that behaviour.
4. Refining the impact of the product based on careful evaluation and analysis

The first two phases of the process can be used for the conceptual design (figuring out what the product should do) and interface design ( figuring out how the product should look).
